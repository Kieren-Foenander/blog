# Wordle AI at /wordle/ai uses Cloudflare Workers AI and AI Gateway.
# Run with `wrangler dev` (or `astro dev` with Cloudflare adapter) so env.AI binding is available.
#
# AI Gateway (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini):
#   - Create an AI Gateway in Cloudflare dashboard (AI Gateway > Create Gateway)
#   - Add provider API keys via BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)
#   - Set AI_GATEWAY_ID in wrangler.jsonc vars to match your gateway ID (default: wordle-gateway)
#
# Workers AI (Llama):
#   - No API keys needed when using env.AI binding
#
# Gemini (credentials-only, no binding support):
#   - Requires CF_ACCOUNT_ID, CF_AIG_ID, CF_AIG_TOKEN in wrangler vars/secrets
#   - Only needed if using the Gemini model option

AI_GATEWAY_ID=wordle-gateway
