  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    Senior Full-Stack Developer | Architecting high-traffic headless commerce at
    scale
  </p>

  <p>
    I build and maintain headless e-commerce platforms serving millions of
    weekly users across multiple countries. Currently driving technical strategy
    at Michael Hill Jeweller, I specialize in end-to-end feature ownership—from
    initial scoping and proof-of-concepts through to production delivery and
    long-term maintainability.
  </p>

  <h2>What I've been focused on:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Platform modernization:</strong> Led a ground-up Nuxt 2 → Nuxt 3 rewrite,
      delivering incrementally using Cloudflare Workers to route traffic seamlessly
      with zero customer disruption
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Resilient payments:</strong> Redesigned critical gift card split payment
      scenarios to ensure accurate payments and proper error handling and observability.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Global scale:</strong> Shipped fully localized checkout experiences
      across 4 languages with feature flags and A/B testing for safe experimentation
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Developer velocity:</strong> Built automated CI/CD pipelines enabling
      reliable 2-week release cadences across monorepo and microservice architectures
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Tech stack:</strong> TypeScript • Vue/Nuxt • NestJS • Salesforce Commerce
    Cloud • Cloudflare Workers • Azure • Docker
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond the code, I mentor junior developers, act as primary code reviewer
    across multiple repositories, and partner closely with product and design to
    translate complex requirements into scalable, user-centric solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Open to connecting with engineers and leaders in e-commerce, headless
    architecture, and modern TypeScript ecosystems.
